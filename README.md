# Portfolio-Website-
Building a portfolio website to show off my projects.  This is part of a codecademy exercise.

My first attempt at using git hub to develop a project.  This is also my first attempt at building a portfolio website.  I am sure that many iterations will follow along the way.
The purpose of the site will be to serve as a livving document that evolves overtime.
